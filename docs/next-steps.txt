he linter errors are fixed.
We have now:
Updated the Convex rooms schema with isPrivate and accessCode.
Modified the rooms.create mutation to handle private room creation and access code generation.
Updated the CreateRoomForm component with a switch for privacy, logic to call the updated mutation, and an alert dialog to display the access code for private rooms before redirecting.
The next logical steps would be:
Visually indicating private rooms on the homepage/room list.
Implementing the logic to prompt for and validate the access code when a user tries to join a private room.
Let me know when you'd like to proceed with those.
