CLEANUP: Removed Old Audio-Only Room Functionality

Description: Removed outdated UI components, Convex schema definitions, and Convex functions related to the old audio-only room system (based on manual WebRTC signaling) to streamline the codebase and focus on the LiveKit-based video room implementation.

Implementation Details:
1. Deleted UI Components:
   - Removed `src/components/rooms/room-card.tsx`
   - Removed `src/components/rooms/create-room-form.tsx`
   - Removed `src/components/rooms/create-room-button.tsx`
2. Updated Component Usage:
   - Modified `src/components/rooms/room-list.tsx` to use `VideoRoomCard` instead of the deleted `RoomCard`.
   - Removed commented-out import of `CreateRoomButton` in `src/app/page.tsx`.
   - Changed "Join Audio Room" button text to "Join Room" in `src/app/rooms/[id]/RoomClientComponent.tsx`.
3. Convex Schema Cleanup:
   - Removed the `webrtcSignaling` table definition from `convex/schema.ts` as it was specific to the old manual signaling.
4. Convex Function Cleanup:
   - Deleted the entire `convex/webrtc.ts` file which contained functions solely for managing the `webrtcSignaling` table.
   - Kept `convex/rooms.ts` largely intact as its functions manage persistent room metadata (`rooms` table) and participants (`roomParticipants`), which are still relevant.

Purpose: This cleanup removes redundant code associated with the deprecated audio-only rooms, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase focused solely on the current LiveKit-based video room functionality.
